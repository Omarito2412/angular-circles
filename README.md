# angular-circles
## Wow, circles!

### What is it?
**angular-circles** is a simple wrapper to use [lugolabs/circles](http://github.com/lugolabs/circles)
in your projects.

Sadly, don't be surprised if something doesn't work, everything is not yet tested.
I will solve bugs if I (or you!) find them.

### How can I use it?
- Include dependencies to your page (angular, circles.js)
- Include angular-circle.js
- Required `angular-circle` as a dependency of your module
- Add the ng-circle attribute `ng-circle` to any div, and always specify a value
- You are ready to go! See the example folder if you want to customize things
(you have two ways to give settings: `module.config()` or HTML attributes)

###Â Can I see it?
Yup, in examples/index.html \o/

### Can I contrib?
Hell yeah, fork, code, JSLint & pull request :)
